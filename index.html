    <h3>Thuy Nguyen - Aspiring UX Designer</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is <span>Thuy Nguyen</span>. I am an aspiring UX Designer. I am currently enrolled in the UCLAx UX Design Certificate Program. I hope to gain coding knowledge from this class. I am using a Macbook Pro.

    <p>
      I had a few issues getting my environment up and running. I didn't know what link to install git at first (since there were so many options) so I just chose homebrew. I also ran into a message in my terminal saying that I need to update my shell to zsh. I am still trying to figure out how to update it.
